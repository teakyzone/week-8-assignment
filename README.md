# What requirements did you achieve?

All required requirements were met

# Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

I would of loved to add some styling via css (can the css styling only be seen through the client on render? Would you be able to see a live update via the Golive)


# If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

My split terminal kept on changing to a node so i had to kill it everytime i wanted to carry on working with my client

For me debugging was my hardest task, I kept on getting error codes on my console for not being able to find 
Again the forEach was
# What went really well and what could have gone better?

I thought I kept my API really simple so that i could fetch it as simply. I only fetched the title in the end but would of liked to render the subheadings on the page too. 

i kept this in my code just so i could remember my intentions but I'd want to code this properly in the future
I'm guessing I have to seperate the title and the heading so they have their own section of code

const newCameraList = document.createElement("section")
newCameraList.textContent = camera.title,camera.subHeading

Creating my buttons went well, the show and hide function well and was fairly simple to do.

^^^ I had to look this up on chatgpt and fact check it on google to ensure I wasn't about to do something that would mess up my assigment or worse my computer
